# This section `services` is where the "servers" are.  Each service provides
# a "server".  Common development use cases are web servers, database
# servers and testing servers.
#
# The purpose of each service is to define how the service (aka server)
# interacts with the host.  So 8080:80 means localhost:8080 is mapped
# to 80 inside the service.
#
# Services that have "build" are modified locally from a Dockerfile. Think
# of them as "customizing" what is installed on the "server".
#
# Services that have "image" are used in a default service configuration.
#
# The "port" maps a TCP/IP port from the service to the host (real computer).
#
# The "volumes" map a directory from the host to inside the service.
#
# All the services in the file share a private common network and can talk
# to each other over that private network using the service name as the
# host name.
